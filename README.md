# ProxyScrape Promo Codes and Latest High-Speed Proxy Deals for 2026

## ProxyScrape Introduction

So you're looking for a solid proxy service that doesn't require a computer science degree to figure out? Let me tell you about ProxyScrape.

Back in 2018, a guy named Thibeau Maerevoet started this thing because he was tired of how complicated it was to find decent free proxies. What began as a simple proxy list service turned into something much bigger. Now they're serving over 10,000 clients globally, and honestly, the growth makes sense.

<img width="2774" height="1565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d24e036f-aecf-47d0-a440-034265fac309" />

Here's what ProxyScrape actually does: they provide you with different types of proxy servers that sit between you and the websites you're accessing. Think of it like having a friend who goes to the store for you—the store sees your friend's ID, not yours. That's basically what a proxy does with your IP address.

The service covers pretty much everything you'd need: residential proxies with over 55 million rotating IPs, datacenter proxies that are lightning fast, dedicated proxies that belong only to you, and even mobile proxies when you need that extra credibility. They're not trying to be fancy about it—they're just giving people the tools they need for web scraping, SEO monitoring, managing multiple accounts, or getting around geo-restrictions.

What really stands out is their approach. They offer both free and paid options, which is rare. The free tier updates every five minutes with fresh proxy lists. Sure, free proxies come with limitations (they're public, so everyone's using them), but it's a great way to test things out or learn the basics without spending money.

For the paid services, they keep things straightforward. Unlimited bandwidth on their datacenter proxies. A 99.9% uptime guarantee. 24/7 support that actually responds. They've built their own infrastructure instead of just reselling someone else's proxies, which means they can actually control the quality.

The company is based in Belgium (Mechelen, to be specific), and they're pretty transparent about their ethical sourcing practices. They're not just scraping random residential IPs—they have processes in place to make sure everything's above board.

Whether you're a developer testing your scraping scripts, a business monitoring competitors' prices, or someone who just needs reliable proxies for their work, ProxyScrape has become one of those services that just works. No drama, no overselling—just proxies that do what they're supposed to do.

**Overall Ratings:**

ProxyScrape maintains a 4.6 out of 5 stars rating on Trustpilot, based on over 450 customer reviews. This "Great" rating reflects widespread satisfaction with the service's performance, reliability, and value proposition.

**What Users Love:**

Users consistently praise several aspects of ProxyScrape's service. The speed and reliability of the proxies stand out, with many customers noting that the proxies work effectively for web scraping, data collection, and automation tasks. The 24/7 customer support receives high marks, with users appreciating the quick response times via live chat—typically responding within minutes rather than hours.

The ease of use is another frequently mentioned positive. ProxyScrape's dashboard is straightforward and doesn't require extensive technical knowledge to navigate. Users appreciate that they can start using proxies within minutes of purchase. The API documentation is clear, making integration smooth for developers.

Many reviewers highlight the service's consistency and uptime. The proxies maintain stable connections even under heavy load, which is crucial for businesses running continuous scraping operations. The flexibility to scale from small test packages to enterprise-level plans without changing providers is valued by growing companies.

**Pricing Feedback:**

The value for money receives positive feedback, especially when users opt for larger packages or annual billing. Customers note that while ProxyScrape isn't the absolute cheapest option, the reliability and performance justify the cost. The absence of hidden fees is appreciated—what you see in pricing is what you pay.

**Areas for Improvement:**

Some users mention that the free proxies, while useful for testing, have limitations (as expected with any free service). The shared nature of free proxies means they're often blocked on sensitive sites. A few reviewers note that premium datacenter proxies don't support username/password authentication, which can be inconvenient for certain use cases.

The monthly expiration of unused residential proxy bandwidth is a point of frustration for some users who prefer non-expiring credits. Additionally, while the support is generally praised, it's primarily available for paying customers, with free users having limited support options.
